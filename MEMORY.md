## Memory focus for this release
- Keep a runnable app-first architecture with safe legal handling of external datasets.
- Maintain compatibility on old SQLite databases via migration.
- Keep branch/main sync reproducible through `scripts/sync_latest_to_main.sh`.
- Keep AI evolution path explicit: dataset management -> training plan -> mobile deployment integration.
